# CRUD-app

This is a repository to demonstrate the practice of writing the same CRUD app 5 times, in 5 languages using 5 different frameworks in 5 days. I completed this with the following:

Language  | Framework
----------| --------------
Python    | Django
Ruby      | Ruby on Rails
PHP       | Laravel
Javascript| Express
Java      | Spring

Some basic styling was done using Bootstrap, but primarly the reason for completing this was to practice how the frontend interacts with the backend and any connected databases. All of the projects utilised SQLite as the quickest and easiest relational database to get setup, and was widely supported out of the box by the majority of the frameworks.

Overall I was amazed at the ease at which you could deploy a project using Ruby on Rails, but really prefered Python and Django as the best example of how the Model View and Controller all interact within an application.
