# CRUD-app

This is a repository to demonstrate the practice of writing the same CRUD app 5 times, in 5 languages using 5 different frameworks. I completed the challenge using the following technologies: 

| Language   | Framework     |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Python     | Django        |
| Ruby       | Ruby on Rails |
| PHP        | Laravel       |
| Typescript | Next.js       |
| Java       | Spring        |

The primary reason for completing this challenge was to get more practice with the MVC model and gain a better understanding of how fullstack applications work. I also loved the challenge of working with a number of new languages that I had never used before, having to rely on my passion for learning and ability to translate between languages to implement all of the apps.

The majority of the projects utilized SQLite as the quickest and easiest relational database to get setup, but I also decided on Postgres for the Java and Typescript apps. The most challenging language and framework I worked with was definitely Java, having never used a statically typed language before.

Overall I was amazed at the ease at which you could deploy a project using Ruby on Rails, but preferred Python and Django as the best example of how the Model View and Controller all interact within an application and plan on utilizing these again for future projects.
